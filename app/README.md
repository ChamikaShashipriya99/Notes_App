# `app` Module

## Purpose and Functionality

The `app` module is the main application module for the Notes_App. It encapsulates all the user interface (UI) elements, business logic, and core functionalities required for the note-taking application. This includes features such as creating, viewing, editing, organizing, and deleting notes.

## Key Components and Features

The primary components of this module are organized within the `com.example.notesapp` package structure. While specific class names require deeper inspection, the module typically includes:

*   **Activities:** Entry points for different screens of the application, such as a main screen for listing notes (`MainActivity`), an activity for editing/creating notes (`EditorActivity` or similar), and potentially settings or detail view activities.
*   **Fragments:** Reusable UI components that might be used within activities, for example, to display a list of notes or a note detail view.
*   **ViewModels:** Components responsible for preparing and managing data for Activities and Fragments, surviving configuration changes, and interacting with the data layer. These would manage note data, UI state, etc.
*   **Data Handling:** Classes related to managing the persistence of notes, which might involve Room database entities, DAOs (Data Access Objects), and a repository.
*   **UI Components:** Custom views, adapters for RecyclerViews (to display lists of notes), and other UI-related helper classes.
*   **Services:** Potentially background services for reminders or synchronization, if such features are part of the application.

## Running Tests

To ensure the stability and correctness of the `app` module, you can run its specific tests using the following Gradle commands from the project's root directory:

### Unit Tests

Unit tests check the logic of individual components like ViewModels, utility classes, and parts of the business logic without needing an Android device or emulator.

```bash
./gradlew :app:test
```

Or, if you are on Windows:

```bash
gradlew.bat :app:test
```

### Instrumented Tests

Instrumented tests run on an Android device or emulator and are used to test UI interactions, database operations, and other components that require an Android framework context.

```bash
./gradlew :app:connectedAndroidTest
```

Or, if you are on Windows:

```bash
gradlew.bat :app:connectedAndroidTest
```

Make sure you have a device or emulator connected and configured before running instrumented tests.
